## Course Objectives

• Gain a comprehensive understanding of the basic concepts of linear programming
including problem formulation, graphical method, and matrix notation.

• Master the simplex method and its variants such as the two-phase simplex method,
revised simplex method, and the Big M-technique for solving linear programming
problems efficiently.

• Learn to formulate and solve balanced and unbalanced transportation problems and
assignment problems, including recognizing and addressing issues like degeneracy.

• Develop skills in analyzing sequencing problems involving job allocation to
machines, understanding critical paths, and differentiating between CPM and PERT
methodologies.

• Acquire proficiency in sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of changes in
parameters on the optimal solution, and explore optimization techniques to enhance
decision-making processes in operational research scenarios.
Learning Outcomes

---

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:

• Students will be able to accurately formulate linear programming problems and
represent them graphically or in matrix notation, distinguishing between bounded,
unbounded, and optimal solutions.

• By the end of the course, students will demonstrate proficiency in applying the
simplex method, two-phase simplex method, and other related techniques to solve
linear programming problems efficiently.

• Students will be able to apply mathematical formulations and solution algorithms to
address balanced and unbalanced transportation problems, assignment problems, and
identify and resolve issues like degeneracy.

• Upon completion of the course, students will exhibit critical thinking skills in
analyzing sequencing problems, identifying critical paths, and understanding the
implications of different scheduling strategies on project completion times.

• Graduates will demonstrate advanced analytical skills through sensitivity analysis,
enabling them to assess the impact of changes in parameters on solution optimality,
and make informed decisions to enhance operational efficiency in real-world
scenarios.
